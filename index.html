                Hey! My name is Kevin Ge and I'm a 21 from Westchester, New York majoring in computer science. I really like building things and getting into the weeds of understanding how each little thing works.
                I'm excited to work at Dali to meet people who also love coding and to potentially work on a project that ends up being deployed! I know there have been some pretty cool projects that have come out of the Dali Lab (College Pulse, Clairways, etc) and 
                I think it'd be fun to be involved.
